# What is Flutter?
A tool that allows you to build native cross-platform (Android, iOS, Web, Desktop) applications - one programming language and codebase.

- **NB:** Cross platform is also known as multiplatform or platform independent.
- **Native App:** An application developed exclusively for a single platform using a native-to-the-operating-system language.
- **Hybrid:** A blend solution that consists of both native and web solutions. Developers embed the code written with web development languages into a native app using Apache Cordova or Ionic's Capacitor.

## Why Flutter?
- Increased time-to-market speed
- Reduced code development time
- The potential ability to go beyond mobile
- Same UI and Business Logic in all platforms
- Custom, animated UI of any complexity available
- Similar to native perfromance
- Own rendering engine
- Simple platform specific logic implementation
